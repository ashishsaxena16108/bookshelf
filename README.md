# React App with Vite

This project is a React application built with Vite, a lightning-fast development server.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js (version 18 or later):** Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en). Node.js also includes npm, the Node Package Manager.

## Setting Up the Project

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-app-name
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will download all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, which will create a bundled version of your React application and serve it at `http://localhost:3000` (the default port) by default. You can view your application in your web browser.

2.  **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):**
    Vite provides hot module replacement (HMR), which means that changes you make to your React components will be reflected in the browser almost instantly without a full page reload. This significantly improves your development experience.

## Building for Production

1.  **Create a production build:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command will create an optimized production build of your React application in the `dist` folder. You can deploy this folder to a web server to host your application in production.

## Additional Notes

- This `README.md` assumes that your project uses a basic file structure with components and other code in the `src` directory. You can adjust the instructions based on your specific project structure.
- For more advanced customization, refer to the official Vite documentation (https://vitejs.dev/).
